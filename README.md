# Butterfield-Train-Line
Train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.
<br />
<hr />
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
<br /> 
    * Train Name
<br />    
    * Destination 
<br />    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
<br />    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
<br /><br /> 
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
<br /><br />  
Users from many different machines must be able to view the same train times.
